## Intent

Make it possible to reconstruct how memory changed, which memories entered context, and what feedback followed—without overwriting the evidence needed for investigation.

## The problem

Current rows answer what the system believes now, not how it arrived there. A counter such as `times_used = 12` cannot explain which conversations used a memory, whether it was actually injected, or which model and query selected it. Mutable history also makes concurrency and audits ambiguous.

## The pattern

Keep canonical memory state for efficient reads and append immutable events for changes and use:

```text
memory_mutation:
  created | corroborated | corrected | superseded | rejected | expired

retrieval_event:
  considered | retrieved | injected | cited | downvoted
```

Each event records memory ID, scope, actor, timestamp, request or conversation ID, reason, and relevant version identifiers. Derive counters and dashboards from events. Retention and privacy policies still apply; append-only means application code does not casually rewrite history, not that data can never be erased.

## Why it works

Events support debugging, eval generation, attribution, concurrency analysis, and product review. They reveal the difference between a memory matching a query and actually influencing a prompt.

## The critical boundary

Telemetry is not truth. A frequently retrieved memory is reachable, not necessarily correct. A downvote says the resulting interaction was unsatisfactory, not that the memory was false. Feed events into review and evaluation; do not silently promote, reject, or delete beliefs from weak behavioral signals.

## Tradeoffs

Event volume grows quickly. Schema evolution and privacy deletion become harder. Causal attribution remains limited: injection does not prove that a model used a memory. Audit events also need transactional coupling to state changes or they can describe mutations that never committed.

## Seen in the atlas

[RainBox](../../systems/rainbox/) combines claim/evidence state with `RetrievalEvent`, feedback, review UI, and eval flows, while explicitly treating telemetry as a review signal rather than truth. [Mem0](../../systems/mem0/) keeps SQLite history around memory changes. [llm-wiki-memory](../../systems/llm-wiki-memory/) uses git history for inspectable mutation groups, demonstrating strong recoverability but also why audit history is not the same as privacy erasure.

## Tests to require

- Mutation and audit event commit or roll back together.
- Distinguish considered, returned, and injected memories.
- Rebuild derived counters from the event stream.
- Deduplicate retried event writes.
- Apply scope authorization to audit queries.
- Exercise retention and true-erasure procedures across events and backups.
